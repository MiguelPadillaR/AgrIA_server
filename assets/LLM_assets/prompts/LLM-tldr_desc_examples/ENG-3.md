**DESCRIPTION:**

The image shows a parcel with a variety of land uses. Extensive areas of grassland with trees (PA) and arable land (TA) are present, along with unproductive zones (IM), buildings (ED) and a watercourse (AG). The varied coloration suggests different states of the vegetation.

**POSSIBLE(S) ECO-REGIMES:**

| Eco-Regime | Likelihood | Estimated Amount (Peninsula) | Estimated Amount (Insular) | Conditions | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 - Extensive grazing** | Moderately probable | 476,56 € | 769,03 € | Maintain an adequate livestock load and respect a minimum grazing period of 120 days per year. | The livestock load and compliance with the grazing period cannot be visually confirmed. |
| **P2A - Establishment of biodiversity islands** | Possible |  Not directly estimable | Not directly estimable | Leave 7% of the pasture area (PA) unmown between January 1 and August 31. | It cannot be visually determined whether the requirements are met. |
| **P2B - Sustainable mowing** | Possible |  Not directly estimable | Not directly estimable | Comply with the unproductive period of 60 consecutive days between June, July and August, and a maximum number of cuts depending on the altitude. | It cannot be visually determined whether the requirements are met. |
| **P3 - Crop rotation with improving species** | Moderately probable | 45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | 73.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 98.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Rotation and improving species must be demonstrated. | Rotation and the use of improving species cannot be visually confirmed. |
| **P4 - No-till farming** | Possible | 45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | 73.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 98.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Conservation agriculture (no-till) is required on at least 40% of the requested surface, with rotation. | It is not possible to visually determine the no-till practice, nor the required rotation. |
| **P5 - Biodiversity areas in arable land and permanent crops** | Moderately probable | 48.56 €/ha | 48.56 €/ha | It is required to comply with the necessary percentages for biodiversity spaces. | It is not possible to determine the extent of the biodiversity areas. |

**TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:** (PA: 15.32 ha; TA: 30.14 ha; IM + AG: 18.76 ha)
