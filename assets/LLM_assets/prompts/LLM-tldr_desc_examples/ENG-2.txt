**DESCRIPTION:**

The image shows a parcel with a clear differentiation of land uses. Extensive areas of arable land (TA) with brown tones are observed, possibly indicating preparation work or fallow, along with an olive grove (OV) area with a darker coloration. Also, unproductive areas (IM) and a small watercourse (AG) are distinguished.

**POSSIBLE(S) ECO-REGIMES:**

*   **P3 - Crop rotation with improving species:** Moderately likely. The presence of arable land (TA) opens the possibility of applying this eco-regime, provided that the requirements for rotation and the use of improving species are met.
    *   **Estimated amount:**
        *   **Without pluriannuality:** TA (Arable Land): 130.74 ha \* 45.94 €/ha = **6,007.07 €** (Peninsula)
        *   **With pluriannuality:** TA (Arable Land): 130.74 ha \* 70.94 €/ha = **9,270.56 €** (Peninsula)
        *   **Condition**: Rotation and improving species must be demonstrated.
    *   **Limitations:** Rotation and the use of improving species cannot be visually confirmed.
*   **P4 - No-till farming:** Possible. Given the information in the image, it cannot be deduced that this practice is being carried out, but it cannot be ruled out.
    *   **Estimated amount:**
        *   **Without pluriannuality:** TA (Arable Land): 130.74 ha \* 45.94 €/ha = **6,007.07 €**
        *   **With pluriannuality:** TA (Arable Land): 130.74 ha \* 70.94 €/ha = **9,270.56 €**
        *   **Condition**: Conservation agriculture (no-till farming) is required on at least 40% of the requested surface, with rotation.
    *   **Limitations:** The practice of no-till farming, nor the required rotation, cannot be visually determined.
*   **P5 - Biodiversity areas in arable land and permanent crops:** Moderately likely. The presence of unproductive areas (IM) and watercourses (AG) could contribute to this eco-regime.
    *   **Estimated amount:** Not directly estimable from the image.
        *   **Condition**: It is required to comply with the necessary percentages for biodiversity areas.
    *   **Limitations**: It is not possible to determine the extent of the biodiversity areas.
*   **P6 - Vegetal covers and inert covers in woody crops:** Possible, if the olive grove is covered by this practice.
    *   **Estimated amount:**
        *   **Without pluriannuality:** OV (Olive Grove): 39.81 ha \* 60.08 €/ha = **2,391.95 €** (Peninsula)
        *   **With pluriannuality:** OV (Olive Grove): 39.81 ha \* 85.08 €/ha = **3,387.83 €** (Peninsula)
        *   **Condition**: Comply with the requirements of the practice (live or inert cover).
    *   **Limitations:** The practice cannot be visually confirmed.

**TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:**

*   **P3 (Rotation with improving species):**  **6,007.07 €** (without pluriannuality) / **9,270.56 €** (with pluriannuality).
*   **P4 (No-till farming):** TA has already been assigned to another ER.
*   **P5 (Biodiversity Areas):** Could not be estimated.
*   **P6 (Vegetal Covers):**  **2,391.95 €** (without pluriannuality) / **3,387.83 €** (with pluriannuality).

**Total: 8,399.02 € / 12,658.39 € (without pluriannuality) / (with pluriannuality)**
