**DESCRIPTION:**

The image shows an arable land (TA) plot with an elongated shape. The vegetation presents a uniform coloration, possibly in a state of winter dormancy.

**POSSIBLE(S) ECO-REGIMES:**

*   **P3 - Crop rotation with improvement species:** Moderately probable. The presence of arable land (TA) opens up the possibility of adhering to this regime.
    *   **Amount Estimation:** The total surface of the plot is 26.72 ha. The amount to be received is 45.94 €/ha (without multi-annuality) or 70.94 €/ha (with multi-annuality).
        *   **Condition**: Rotation and improvement species must be demonstrated.
    *   **Limitations:** Rotation and the use of improvement species cannot be visually confirmed.
*   **P4 - No-till farming:** Possible. Given the information in the image, it cannot be deduced that this practice is being carried out, but it cannot be ruled out.
    *   **Amount Estimation:** The total surface of the plot is 26.72 ha. The amount to be received is 45.94 €/ha (without multi-annuality) or 70.94 €/ha (with multi-annuality).
        *   **Condition**: Conservation agriculture (no-till) is required on at least 40% of the requested surface, with rotation.
    *   **Limitations:** It is not possible to visually determine the no-till practice, nor the required rotation.
*   **P5 - Biodiversity areas in arable land and permanent crops:** Possible. This regime involves dedicating a percentage of the total area to non-productive surfaces or elements.
    *   **Amount Estimation:** The total area of the plot is 26.72 ha. **To be eligible for P5, 7% of the total area must be dedicated to biodiversity spaces.** This would be 1.87 hectares (26.72 ha * 0.07). The estimated aid amount is 48.56 €/ha. Therefore, the estimated aid amount for the biodiversity spaces in the plot would be 90.80 €.
        *   **Condition**: Allocate 7% of the surface to biodiversity spaces, in addition to those of BCAM 8.
    *   **Limitations:** It is not possible to determine the extent of biodiversity surfaces.

**TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:**

*   **P3 (Rotation with improving species):** 1,225.82 € (without multi-annuality) / 1,896.82 € (with multi-annuality)
*   **P4 (No-till farming):** The TA has already been assigned to another ER.
*   **P5 (Biodiversity Spaces):** 90.80 €

**TOTAL: 1,316.62 € (without multi-annuality) / 1,987.62 € (with multi-annuality)
