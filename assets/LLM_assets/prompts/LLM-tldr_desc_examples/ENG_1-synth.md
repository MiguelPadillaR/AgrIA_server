**DESCRIPTION:**

The parcel's image, date from October 12th, 2024, is characterized by a strong presence of Pastures (PS) and natural elements, suggesting a predominantly livestock-based farm model. The largest areas are dedicated to Grassland (PS), Wooded Pastures (PA) and Forestry (FO), while Olive Groves (OV) account for a small portion, along with  Water Surfaces (AG) completing the land uses. There is a presence of Unproductive (IM) land, Roads (CA) and Buildings (ED). The mix of pasture and forestry indicates high eligibility for low-intensity ecoschemes.

**POSSIBLE ECO-SCHEMES:**

| **Ecoscheme** | **Viability** | **Estimated Rate (Peninsular)*** | **Estimated Rate (Insular)*** | **Conditions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1 - Extensive Grazing** | **High** | 27.27 €/ha | 49.27 €/ha | Maintain minimum and maximum livestock density (e.g., $0.2 \text{ LU/ha}$ to $1.2 \text{ LU/ha}$), and respect a non-grazing or mowing period on at least $50\%$ of the area. |
| **P3 - Crop Rotation with Enhancing Species** | **High** | 44.32 €/ha | 72.32 €/ha | Rotate 50% of the crop area annually or 10% of the land with enhancing species (5% for legumes) |
| **P4 - No-Till Farming (Direct Sowing)** | **High** | 44.32 €/ha | 72.32 €/ha | 40% of the requested area must be left untilled. |
| **P5 (A) - Biodiversity Spaces (Cultivated/Permanent)** | **High** | 42.99 €/ha | N/A | Reserve a minimum strip in cultivated land or perform other specific biodiversity practices (applies to FO, which is often considered eligible for P5). |
| **P5 (B) - Biodiversity Spaces (Under Water)** | **Possible** | 145.09 €/ha | N/A | Applicable to cultivated areas under water (e.g., rice fields - applies to AG if used for this purpose). |
| **P6 - Plant Cover (Spontaneous or Sown Plant Cover)** | **Possible** | 59.12 €/ha | 99.12 €/ha | Live cover from Oct 1st to Mar 31st. Pest eradication is allowed. |
| **P7 - Plant Cover (Inert Plant Cover from Pruning Remains)** | **Possible** | 59.12 €/ha | 99.12 €/ha | Shred and distribute remains uniformly over the surface |
| **Non-Eligible** | Possible | N/A | N/A | This category is reserved for non-agricultural land that does not fit into any of the CAP's Eco-schemes |

**With pluriannuality, an additional 25 €/ha is paid for P3, P4, P6, and P7. Rates may vary based on irrigation or land surface extension.*

**ESTIMATED TOTAL PAYMENT:**

| **Ecoscheme** | **Land Use Class Eligible** | **Total Area (ha)** | **Base Payment (€)*** | **Total with Pluriannuality (€)*** | **Applicable** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1 - Extensive Grazing** | PS, PA | 10.00 | 272.70 | 272.70 | Yes |
| **P3/P4 - Rotation/No-Till** | TA | 5.00 | 221.60 | 361.60 | Yes |
| **P5 (A) - Biodiversity Spaces** | FO | 4.00 (FO) | 171.99 | 171.99 | Yes - Excluded TA: used for P3/P4 |
| **P5 (B) - Biodiversity Spaces (Under Water)** | AG | 1.00 | 145.10 | 145.10 | Yes |
| **P6/P7 - Plant Cover (Permanent Crops)** | OV | 2.00 | 118.24 | 168.24 | Yes |
| **Non-Eligible** | IM, ED, CA | 3.00 (IM, ED, CA) | N/A | N/A | Yes - Excluded FO: used for P5 (A) |

**RESULTS:**

- **Valid ES(s): P1 + P3/P4 + P5 (A/B) + P6/P7**
- **Total amount: 929.63€ / 1,116.63€** (without or with pluriannuality)
- **Clarifications:** **TA** (Arable Land) was assigned to **P3/P4** (Rotation/No-Till) because this option offers the highest financial benefit per hectare, including the pluriannuality supplement (**$69.32 €/\text{ha}$**), making it more favorable than P5. **PS** remains assigned to **P1**. **OV** is assigned to **P6/P7** for the highest rate among permanent crop options. The increase in the pluriannuality total is due to the $5.00 \text{ ha}$ of **TA** and the $2.00 \text{ ha}$ of **OV** both being eligible for the $+25 €/\text{ha}$ supplement.

To offer a more precise valuation of the parcel, I would need to know the following:

* **Actual Land Use:** Is the **AG** surface used for 'cultivo bajo agua' (e.g., rice fields), which has the highest fixed rate, or for other purposes?
* **P1 Compliance:** What is the actual livestock unit density on the **10.00 ha of PS** to confirm compliance with the P1 requirements?
* **VI/FY Rate Adjustment:** Do the **Olive Groves (OV)** have steep slopes, as this would increase the P6/P7 base rate from **59.12 €/ha** to a higher value (**110.56 €/ha** or **131.38 €/ha**)?

I can elaborate on a step-by-step plan to ensure all eligible land complies with these Ecoschemes or guide you through the initial application process if you wish.
