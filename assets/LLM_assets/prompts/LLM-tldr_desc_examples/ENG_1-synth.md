**DESCRIPTION:**

The parcel's image, date from October 12th, 2024, is characterized by a strong presence of Pastures (PS) and Arable Land (TA), suggesting a large, predominantly livestock and field-crop farm model. The largest areas are dedicated to Grassland (PS), Wooded Pastures (PA) and **Arable Land (TA)**. Olive Groves (OV) account for a significant portion, along with Water Surfaces (AG) and Forestry (FO) completing the land uses. There is a presence of Unproductive (IM) land, Roads (CA) and Buildings (ED). The **sheer size of the PS/PA (100.00 ha), TA (80.00 ha), and OV (20.00 ha) areas forces the application of the Tier 2 (lower) payment rates** for the respective Eco-schemes.

**RESULTS:**

<center>

| Applicable Eco-scheme* | Total Aid (w/o Plur.) | Total Aid (with Plur.) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **P1 + P3/P4 + P5 (A/B) + P6/P7** | **7550.45 €** | **10050.45 €** |

</center>

- **Clarifications:** P3/P4 payment includes a lower rate for the 10.00 ha exceeding the 70 ha threshold. P6/P7 payment includes a lower rate for the 5.00 ha exceeding the 15 ha threshold. The total pluriannuality bonus of 2500.00 € is applied to the 100.00 ha of eligible land (TA + OV).

To offer a more precise valuation of the parcel, I would need to know the following:

* **P1 (Humid/Mediterranean):** Is the PS/PA area classified as Mediterranean or Humid pasture? The Humid rate is higher (43.64 €/ha).
* **P3/P4 Type:** Which specific option (Rotation or No-Till) is being applied to the TA?
* **P6/P7 Slope:** Do the Olive Groves (OV) have steep slopes, as this would increase the P6/P7 base rate from 41.384 €/ha to the higher Tier 2 values (77.392 €/ha or 102.910 €/ha)?

I can also assit you to elaborate a plan to implement the necessary modifications to qualify for the desired ES in your state. If you need, I can help you start with the paperwork needed to apply for CAP ES subventions.
