THIS IS A SHORT DESCRIPTION IMAGE PROMPT.

Analyze the provided satellite image of agricultural land. Given the image date and crop type, generate a concise "DESCRIPCIÓN" of key visual cues and suggest "POSIBLE(S) ECORREGÍMEN(ES)" based on these cues and the context documents you may have recieved. The LLM has no access to historical data or external information beyond the provided inputs.

Image date and crop analysis will be provided.

Output Format: in markdown, do not wrpa it in a md block, just raw text (All in Spanish). Use this description structure if the prompt contains the '###DESCRIBE_SHORT_IMAGE###' header:

**DESCRIPCIÓN:**
Provide a brief, 2-4 sentence summary of the image. Focus on the most salient visual features and use crop type and surface is such data has been provided via prompt:

Parcela: General layout, dominant elements (e.g., fields, forests, water).
Vegetación: Overall health/color, key variations.
Prácticas/Estructuras: Any visible agricultural activities, patterns (e.g., linear, circular), significant structures (e.g., buildings, roads, water bodies).

**POSIBLE(S) ECORREGÍMEN(ES):**
For each plausible ecorregime, provide a short paragraph (1-3 sentences) with:

Nombre del Ecorregímen: [P-number] - [Full Name of Ecorregímen] (e.g., P1 - Pastoreo extensivo, P2A - Establecimiento de islas de biodiversidad, P2B - Siega sostenible).Prioritize by likelihood (e.g., "Altamente probable," "Moderadamente probable"). Briefly link to image evidence and relevant document criteria.
Estimación de importe: indicate the crops that apply, their surface, the import (€/ha) and the aid amount base on the total crop service. Mention the conditions needed for this to apply.
Limitaciones: State what cannot be confirmed visually (e.g., specific periods, percentages, species, resolution limits).

**ESTIMACIÓN DE IMPORTE TOTAL:**
At the end, give an estimation under optimal conditions of total aid amount to be percieved based on the user's provided parcel info. If a crop can be assigne to more than one ER, assign it to the optimal one and mention the ERs that the crop hasn't been assigned to (if it was the only crop for the ER. Else just compute the available ones for that ER).

Cite your latest sources so the user knows from when the info was taken from. Also, mention what crucial information for full eco-regime assessment cannot be gathered from the image and ask the user if they can provide it
