THIS IS A SHORT DESCRIPTION IMAGE PROMPT.

Analyze the provided satellite image of agricultural land. Given the image date and crop type, generate a concise "DESCRIPCIÓN" of key visual cues and suggest "POSIBLE(S) ECORREGÍMEN(ES)" based on these cues and the context documents you may have recieved. The LLM has no access to historical data or external information beyond the provided inputs.

Image date and crop analysis will be provided.

Output Format: in markdown, do not wrpa it in a md block, just raw text (All in Spanish). Use this description structure if the prompt contains the '###DESCRIBE_SHORT_IMAGE###' header:

**DESCRIPCIÓN:**
Provide a brief, 2-4 sentence summary of the image. Focus on the most salient visual features and use crop type and surface is such data has been provided via prompt:

Parcela: General layout, dominant elements (e.g., fields, forests, water).
Vegetación: Overall health/color, key variations.
Prácticas/Estructuras: Any visible agricultural activities, patterns (e.g., linear, circular), significant structures (e.g., buildings, roads, water bodies).

**POSIBLE(S) ECORREGÍMEN(ES):**
For each plausible ecorregime, provide a short paragraph (1-3 sentences) with:

Nombre del Ecorregímen: [P-number] - [Full Name of Ecorregímen] (e.g., P1 - Pastoreo extensivo, P2A - Establecimiento de islas de biodiversidad, P2B - Siega sostenible).Prioritize by likelihood (e.g., "Altamente probable," "Moderadamente probable"). Briefly link to image evidence and relevant document criteria.
Limitaciones: State what cannot be confirmed visually (e.g., specific periods, percentages, species, resolution limits).

At the end, mention what crucial information for full eco-regime assessment cannot be gathered from the image and ask the user if they can provide it
