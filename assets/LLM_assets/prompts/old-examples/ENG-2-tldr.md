**DESCRIPTION:**

The image shows a parcel with a clear differentiation of land uses. Extensive areas of arable land (TA) with brown tones are observed, possibly indicating preparation work or fallow, along with an olive grove (OV) area with a darker coloration. Also, unproductive areas (IM) and a small watercourse (AG) are distinguished.

**POSSIBLE(S) ECO-REGIMES:**

| Eco-Regime | Likelihood | Estimated Amount (Peninsula) | Conditions (Essential Requirements) | Limitations (What cannot be visually confirmed) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P3 - Crop rotation with improving species** | Moderately likely | 45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Rotation and improving species must be demonstrated. | Rotation and the use of improving species cannot be visually confirmed. |
| **P4 - No-till farming** | Possible | 45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Conservation agriculture (no-till farming) is required on at least 40% of the requested surface, with rotation. | The practice of no-till farming, nor the required rotation, cannot be visually determined. |
| **P5 - Biodiversity areas in arable land and permanent crops** | Moderately likely | Not directly estimable. | It is required to comply with the necessary percentages for biodiversity areas. | It is not possible to determine the extent of the biodiversity areas. |
| **P6 - Vegetal covers and inert covers in woody crops** | Possible | 60.08 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 85.08 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Comply with the requirements of the practice (live or inert cover). | The practice cannot be visually confirmed. |

**TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:** (Arable Land - 130.74 ha; Olive Grove - 39.81 ha)

| Eco-Regime | Surface (ha) | Peninsula (without multi-annuality) | Peninsula (with multi-annuality) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P3 (Crop rotation with improving species)** | 130.74 | 6,007.07 € | 9,270.56 € |
| **P4 (No-till farming)** | 130.74 | 6,007.07 € | 9,270.56 € |
| **P5 (Biodiversity Areas)** | - | Could not be estimated. | Could not be estimated. |
| **P6 (Vegetal Covers)** | 39.81 | 2,391.95 € | 3,387.83 € |
| **TOTAL** | 170.55 | **8,399.02 €** | **12,658.39 €** |
