**DESCRIPTION:**

The image shows an arable land (TA) plot with an elongated shape. The vegetation presents a uniform coloration, possibly in a state of winter dormancy.

**POSSIBLE(S) ECO-REGIMES:**

| Eco-Regime | Likelihood | Estimated Amount (Península) | Estimated Amount (Insular) | Conditions | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P3 - Crop rotation with improving species** | Moderately probable | 45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | 73.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 98.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Rotation and improving species must be demonstrated. | Rotation and the use of improvement species cannot be visually confirmed. |
| **P4 - No-till farming** | Possible | 45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | 73.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) / 98.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality) | Conservation agriculture (no-till) is required on at least 40% of the requested surface, with rotation. | It is not possible to visually determine the no-till practice, nor the required rotation. |
| **P5 - Biodiversity areas in arable land and permanent crops** | Possible | 48.56 €/ha | 48.56 €/ha | Allocate 7% of the surface to biodiversity spaces, in addition to those of BCAM 8. | It is not possible to determine the extent of biodiversity surfaces. |

**TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:** (26.72 ha)

| Eco-Regime | Surface (ha) | Peninsula (without pluriannuality) | Peninsula (with pluriannuality) | Insular (without pluriannuality) | Insular (with pluriannuality) |
