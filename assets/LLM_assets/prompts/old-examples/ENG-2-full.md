## DESCRIPTION:

*   **Parcel Details:** The image shows an elongated and defined parcel, with a clear predominance of olive groves (OV). Areas of arable land (TA) and unproductive zones (IM) are also observed. The distribution of crops within the parcel is heterogeneous. The total admissible surface is approximately 121.91 ha.
*   **Vegetation:** In the olive groves (OV), the vegetation presents homogeneity in coloration, with tones that suggest photosynthetic activity typical of the month of September. Arable lands (TA) could be cultivated or fallow, depending on the type of crop and agricultural practices. The unproductive zones (IM) show a darker coloration, which could indicate spontaneous vegetation.
*   **Patterns/Structures:** No defined crop patterns or specific structures can be seen due to the image resolution.
*   **Agricultural Practices:** Specific agricultural practices cannot be discerned with the current resolution. The date of the image (September 2024) could indicate the preparation for the olive harvest or work in the arable lands.

## POSSIBLE ECO-REGIMES:

### P3 - Crop Rotation with Improvement Species

*   **Justification:** The practice of crop rotation with improving species is applicable in arable land (TA) if rotation and the use of improving species are demonstrated.
*   **Estimated amount:** The surface of arable land (TA) is 15.42 ha, and under optimal conditions, the amount is **45.94 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 70.94 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if it's in the Peninsula, and **73.94 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 98.94 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if it's in the Islands.
*   **Limitations:** It is impossible to visually confirm the crop rotation or the presence of improving species. The crop history of the parcel is required.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** It is not possible to accurately infer compliance with this practice since we cannot see the crops at present.
*   **Data Gaps:** It is essential to know the crop history and the declaration of agricultural practices carried out on the parcel, including the species used.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The earthy tones of the plowed soil are ambiguous, since they do not allow knowing the crops sown in the past.

### P4 - No-Till Farming

*   **Justification:** The practice of no-till farming could be implemented on arable lands (TA).
*   **Estimated amount:** The surface of arable land (TA) is 15.42 ha, and under optimal conditions, the amount is **45.94 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 70.94 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if it's in the Peninsula, and **73.94 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 98.94 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if it's in the Islands.
*   **Limitations:** The image does not allow us to visually confirm if the no-till practice is applied. Inspection on the ground and/or records of agricultural practices are needed.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The low resolution prevents identifying whether work has been carried out on the land, making it impossible to determine compliance.
*   **Data Gaps:** We need information on crop practices, especially if no-till farming is applied and in what percentage.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The appearance of the soil is ambiguous and does not allow determining whether no-till farming has been carried out or whether work has been carried out.

### P5 - Biodiversity Spaces

*   **Justification:** The presence of unproductive zones (IM) could be accounted for within the eco-scheme of biodiversity spaces, provided that they meet the established criteria.
*   **Estimated amount:** The unit amount is **48.56 €/ha**.
*   **Limitations:** It is not possible to determine from the image, neither the exact amount of biodiversity spaces, nor their distribution, nor their adequacy to the criteria of the eco-scheme.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The resolution of the image limits the precise accounting of landscape elements.
*   **Data Gaps:** Information is needed on the SIGPAC classification of the parcel and the total surface area of the farm to determine the required percentage.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** It is not possible to know if the unproductive surfaces meet the requirements for their classification and accounting within this eco-scheme (for example, biodiversity margins with specific characteristics).

### P6 - Spontaneous or Sown Vegetation Covers

*   **Justification:** This practice is applicable to woody crops, such as olive groves (OV). The aim is to promote carbon capture, reduce erosion, and improve biodiversity through the establishment of a living plant cover.
*   **Estimated amount:** For the Peninsula, the amount amounts to **60.08 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 85.08 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is less than 15 ha, and to **42.056 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 67.056 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is greater than 15 ha. For the Islands, the amount amounts to **100.08 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 125.08 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is less than 15 ha, and to **82.056 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 107.056 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is greater than 15 ha.
*   **Limitations:** It is not possible to visually determine if there is a plant cover, nor if it complies with the requirements of the eco-scheme P6, based on the image.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The resolution of the image does not allow determining the presence of plant cover and its compliance with the requirements.
*   **Data Gaps:** It is essential to know if there is a plant cover in the olive grove and if it meets the criteria for the permanence period established by the competent authority (four months between October 1 and March 31).
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The homogeneity of the olive grove vegetation could indicate plant cover, but it cannot be assured with certainty.

### P7 - Inert Covers of Pruning Remains

*   **Justification:** This practice, also applicable to woody crops, seeks to promote carbon capture, the maintenance of soil moisture, the control of erosion, and the improvement of organic matter through the use of pruning remains as an inert cover.
*   **Estimated amount:** For the Peninsula, the amount amounts to **60.08 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 85.08 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is less than 15 ha, and to **42.056 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 67.056 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is greater than 15 ha. For the Islands, the amount amounts to **100.08 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 125.08 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is less than 15 ha, and to **82.056 €/ha (without plurianuality) or 107.056 €/ha (with plurianuality)**, if the surface is greater than 15 ha.
*   **Limitations:** It is not possible to visually determine if pruning remains have been applied to the parcel.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The resolution of the image does not allow determining if pruning remains have been applied and if they meet the requirements of the eco-scheme.
*   **Data Gaps:** It is essential to know if pruning remains have been used as an inert cover and if the established management criteria are met.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The image does not provide information on the management of pruning remains.

## TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:

*   **P3 (Crop rotation with improving species):** **701,07 €** (without plurianuality) / **1.089,94 €** (with plurianuality) - *TA has been assigned to this ES because the amount to be received is greater.*
*   **P4 (No-Till Farming):** Already assigned
*   **P5 (Biodiversity Spaces):** The area destined for the unproductive zones is 1.06 ha. The total amount to be received would be **51,44 €**.
*   **P6 (Spontaneous or Sown Vegetation Covers):** The surface of the olive grove is 96,39 ha. The total amount to be received would be:
    *   **4.044,99 €** (without plurianuality) or **6.456,31 €** (with plurianuality)
*   **P7 (Inert Covers of Pruning Remains):** The surface of the olive grove is 96,39 ha. The total amount to be received would be:
    *   **4.044,99 €** (without plurianuality) or **6.456,31 €** (with plurianuality)

**Total estimated: 8.842,49 € (without plurianuality) / 12.453,61 € (with plurianuality)**
