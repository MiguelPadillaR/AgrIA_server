 **DESCRIPTION:**

The satellite image, taken on January 6, 2022, displays a long, rectangular parcel with a dominant land use of arable land (TA). There are also features of roads (CA) and unproductive land (IM) within the parcel. The coloration appears uniform, which could suggest that the land is in a fallow state or recently prepared for planting, given the date.

**RESULTS**

Some of the land uses belong to multiple ERs. According to PAC regulation, only one ES may be assigned to a single land use, so the most favourable ones have been considered for the calculation.

- **Valid ES(s): P3/P4**
- **Total Amount: 5929.93€ / 9156.93€** (with or without pluriannuality)
- **Clarifications:** Despite P5 offering a better base amount, if planning to use pluriannuality on the long run, P3/P4 offer better aids.
