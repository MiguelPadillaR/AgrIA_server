 **DESCRIPTION:**

The satellite image, taken on October 3, 2025, depicts a parcel with varied topography and diverse land uses. Citrus crops (CI) are the predominant use, with 66.47 ha, complemented by forest areas (FO), unproductive areas (IM), shrub pastures (PR), scrubland (MT), and roadways (CA). Two water reservoirs are also observed. The coloration of the citrus suggests vegetative activity or preparation for harvest.

**RESULTS:**

-   **Valid ES(s): P5**
-   **Total Amount: 5659.57€ + 3992.60€ / 5659.65€** (with or without pluriannuality)
-   **Clarifications:** Citrus crops can be assigned to P5, P6 or P7. The remaining uses (CA, FO, IM, MT, PR) can be assigned to P5. Since citrus crops cannot be assigned to 2 ERs at the same tiem, the most profitable would be P5.
