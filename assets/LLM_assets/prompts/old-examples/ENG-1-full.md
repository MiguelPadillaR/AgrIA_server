## DESCRIPTION:

*   **Parcel Details:** The image shows an irregularly shaped parcel with a clear heterogeneity in the distribution of land uses. Extensive areas of grassland with trees (PA) and grasslands (PS) are observed, along with arable land (TA) and forest areas (FO). Unproductive zones (IM), shrub pastures (PR), and buildings (ED) are also distinguished. The total admissible surface is approximately 169 hectares.
*   **Vegetation:** The vegetation presents a variety of tones, which suggests different types of vegetation and/or phenological stages. Forested areas (FO) show a darker coloration, indicating dense vegetation. Grasslands (PS) and grassland with trees (PA) exhibit variable tones, possibly related to vegetation density, species, and time of year. Arable lands (TA), with a 100% irrigation coefficient, may present different colors depending on the crop or soil condition in January 2025.
*   **Patterns/Structures:** No defined crop patterns are appreciated due to the low resolution, although the presence of different grassland and arable land zones suggests a differentiated management. The buildings (ED) appear as small isolated structures.
*   **Agricultural Practices:** The image does not allow direct inference of specific agricultural practices. The date of the image (January 2025) could indicate the presence of a plant cover in the arable lands (TA), or failing that, fallow land. In pasture areas, some grazing management practice could be observed, although it cannot be confirmed due to the resolution.

## POSSIBLE ECO-REGIMES:

### P1 - Extensive Grazing

*   **Justification:** The presence of grassland with trees (PA), grasslands (PS), and shrub pastures (PR) suggests that this practice could be viable. It is required to maintain an adequate livestock load and respect a minimum grazing period.
*   **Estimated amount:** The unit amount is **35.891965 €/ha** (Tramo 1) if located in the Peninsula and **57.891965 €/ha** (Tramo 1) if located in the Islands. The amount is **43.58 €/ha** (Tramo 2) and **49.23 €/ha** (Tramo 2) respectively. It applies to the surfaces of wet and Mediterranean pastures.
*   **Limitations:** The livestock load, the grazing period, and the type of pastures cannot be visually confirmed.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The image resolution does not allow determining the vegetation density or the presence of animals, making it difficult to evaluate the livestock load.
*   **Data Gaps:** Information is needed about the type of pasture (wet or Mediterranean), the number of animals, the grazing period, and the type of livestock.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The image does not allow distinguishing whether the pasture areas are suitable for extensive grazing, nor whether the livestock load requirements are met.

### P3 - Crop Rotation with Improvement Species

*   **Justification:** Crop rotation with improving species is applicable in arable land (TA) if rotation and the use of improving species are demonstrated.
*   **Estimated amount:** The surface of arable land (TA) is 71,08 ha, and, under optimal conditions, the amount amounts to **45.94 €/ha (without pluriannuality) or 70.94 €/ha (with pluriannuality)**.
*   **Limitations:** It is impossible to visually confirm the crop rotation or the presence of improving species. The crop history of the parcel is required.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** It is not possible to accurately infer compliance with this practice since we cannot see the crops at present.
*   **Data Gaps:** It is essential to know the crop history and the declaration of agricultural practices carried out on the parcel, including the species used.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The earthy tones of the plowed soil are ambiguous, since they do not allow knowing the crops sown in the past.

### P5 - Biodiversity Spaces

*   **Justification:** The presence of forest zones (FO), unproductive areas (IM), grasslands (PS), and shrub pastures (PR) can be accounted for in the eco-scheme for biodiversity spaces.
*   **Estimated amount:** The unit amount is **48.56 €/ha**.
*   **Limitations:** The image does not allow determining the exact quantity of biodiversity spaces or their distribution, nor the SIGPAC classification, required for the detailed evaluation.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The image resolution limits the precise accounting of landscape elements.
*   **Data Gaps:** Information is needed about the SIGPAC classification of the parcel and the total surface area of the farm to determine the required percentage.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** It is not possible to know if the unproductive surfaces meet the requirements for their classification and accounting within this eco-scheme (for example, biodiversity margins with specific characteristics).

## TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:

*   **P1 (Extensive Grazing):** The surface of PA, PS and PR that are viable for grazing is 78,49 ha.
    *   Assuming the farm is in the Peninsula, the amount is **2.817,12 €** (Tramo 1) and **3.414,65 €** (Tramo 2)
    *   Assuming the farm is in the Islands, the amount is **4.547,09 €** (Tramo 1) and **3.860,32 €** (Tramo 2)
*   **P3 (Crop rotation with improving species):** **32.661,47 €** (without plurianuality) / **50.387,54 €** (with plurianuality) - *TA has been assigned to this ES because the amount to be received is greater.*
*   **P5 (Biodiversity Spaces):** **35.549,37 €**

**Total estimated (Peninsula): 71.027,99 € (without plurianuality) / 88.754,06 € (with plurianuality)**
**Total estimated (Islands): 72.777,98 € (without plurianuality) / 90.504,05 € (with plurianuality)**
