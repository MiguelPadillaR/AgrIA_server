## DESCRIPTION:

*   **Parcel Details:** The image shows a large, irregularly shaped parcel with a heterogeneous distribution of land uses. Extensive areas of olive groves (OV), arable land (TA), and shrub pastures (PR) are identified. Additionally, unproductive areas (IM) and roadways (CA) are observed. The total admissible surface is 1929239.629 m2 (approximately 193 ha). The olive groves and arable land benefit from a 100% irrigation coefficient.
*   **Vegetation:** The coloration in March 2025 is varied, which suggests different phenological stages and types of vegetation. The olive groves (OV) could show an initial vegetative state. Arable lands (TA) and shrub pastures (PR) present a range of tones, possibly indicating preparatory work, fallow, or vegetation at the beginning of the cycle.
*   **Patterns/Structures:** A circular pattern is observed in one area, possibly indicating irrigation by a center pivot. No clear crop patterns are discernible due to the resolution, but the distribution of different crop types suggests a differentiated management of the parcel.
*   **Agricultural Practices:** In the arable lands (TA), the image suggests soil preparation work or the presence of cover crops. The date (March 2025) could indicate the start of the growing season. The olive groves (OV) could be in the preparation phase for the new season.

## POSSIBLE ECO-REGIMES:

### P3 - Crop rotation with improvement species

*   **Justification:** Crop rotation with improvement species is applicable in arable lands (TA). The image suggests the possibility of rotations in these areas.
*   **Estimated amount:** The area of ​​arable land is 54.39 ha. Under optimal conditions, the amount amounts to **45.94 €/ha (without multi-annual) or 70.94 €/ha (with multi-annual)**, if the plot is located in the Peninsula. If it is located in the Islands, the amount would be **73.94 €/ha (without multi-annual) or 98.94 €/ha (with multi-annual)**.
*   **Limitations:** It is not possible to visually confirm crop rotation, nor the presence of improving species. The crop history of the plot is required.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The resolution does not allow verifying if specific rotation practices are being applied.
*   **Data Gaps:** It is essential to know the crop history and the declaration of agricultural practices carried out on arable land, including the species used.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The soil tones are ambiguous and do not allow to know with certainty the crops sown in the past or present.

### P4 - No-till farming

*   **Justification:** The practice of no-till farming is viable in arable lands (TA). The image does not show evidence of tillage, which could suggest the application of this practice.
*   **Estimated amount:** The area of ​​arable land is 54.39 ha. Under optimal conditions, the amount amounts to **45.94 €/ha (without multi-annual) or 70.94 €/ha (with multi-annual)**, if the plot is located in the Peninsula. If it is located in the Islands, the amount would be **73.94 €/ha (without multi-annual) or 98.94 €/ha (with multi-annual)**.
*   **Limitations:** The image does not allow us to verify if no-till farming is being applied. Inspection on the ground and/or records of agricultural practices are needed.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The low resolution prevents identifying whether work has been carried out on the land.
*   **Data Gaps:** Information is needed on crop practices, especially if no-till farming is applied and in what percentage.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The appearance of the soil is ambiguous and does not allow determining whether no-till farming has been carried out or whether work has been carried out.

### P5 - Biodiversity spaces in arable land and permanent crops

*   **Justification:** The presence of unproductive areas (IM), shrub pastures (PR), and roadways (CA), as well as the olive groves (OV), can be considered as non-productive elements to comply with the eco-scheme for biodiversity spaces.
*   **Estimated amount:** The unit amount is **48.56 €/ha**.
*   **Limitations:** The image does not allow determining the exact amount of biodiversity spaces, their distribution, nor their adequacy to the criteria of the eco-scheme.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The image resolution limits the precise accounting of landscape elements.
*   **Data Gaps:** Information is needed on the SIGPAC classification of the plot and the total surface area of the farm to determine the required percentage.
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** It is not possible to determine with certainty whether the unproductive areas, shrub pastures, and roadways meet the requirements for their accounting within this eco-scheme.

### P6 - Spontaneous or sown vegetation covers

*   **Justification:** This practice is applicable to woody crops, such as olive groves (OV).
*   **Estimated amount:** For the Peninsula, the amount amounts to **60.08 €/ha (without pluriannuality) or 85.08 €/ha (with pluriannuality)**, if the surface is less than 15 ha, and to **42.056 €/ha (without pluriannuality) or 67.056 €/ha (with pluriannuality)**, if the surface is greater than 15 ha. For the Islands, the amount amounts to **100.08 €/ha (without pluriannuality) or 125.08 €/ha (with pluriannuality)**, if the surface is less than 15 ha, and to **82.056 €/ha (without pluriannuality) or 107.056 €/ha (with pluriannuality)**, if the surface is greater than 15 ha.
*   **Limitations:** It is not possible to visually determine if there is a plant cover in the parcel, nor if it complies with the requirements for ES P6. Information on the duration and characteristics of the cover is required.
*   **Impact of Resolution:** The resolution of the image does not allow determining the presence of plant cover.
*   **Data Gaps:** It is essential to know if there is a plant cover in the olive grove and if it meets the criteria for the permanence period established by the competent authority (four months between October 1 and March 31).
*   **Visual Ambiguity:** The homogeneity of the olive grove vegetation could indicate a specific management, but it cannot be stated with certainty if it is a plant cover.

## TOTAL AMOUNT ESTIMATION:

*   **P3 (Crop rotation with improvement species):** **2,498.99 €** (without pluriannuality) / **3,846.96 €** (with pluriannuality) - *TA has been assigned to this ES because the amount to be received is greater.*
*   **P4 (No-Till Farming):** Already assigned TA to another ES.
*   **P5 (Biodiversity Spaces):** **93,677.35 €**
*   **P6 (Spontaneous or Sown Vegetation Covers):** **35,695.65 €** (without pluriannuality) / **56,786.48 €** (with pluriannuality)

**Total estimated: 131,871.99 € (without pluriannuality) / 153,003.82 € (with pluriannuality)**
